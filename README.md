# three-requirejs-bower-bootstrap

This is just a configuration for:

bundling AMD modules using requirejs optimizer (via grunt plugin)
using almond AMD loader
updating requirejs config when packages are installed via bower
including three.js and almond by default

I planned to add some default three.js objects and create a better scaffold structure as a better foundation for bigger projects, but I've switched to using browserify in favor of having access to small, modular npm modules which can be useful in the browser.
